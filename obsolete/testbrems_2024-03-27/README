This simulation has two objectives:

(1) Find the energy deposition profile per layer, and the face-on (here xy-plane) spatial energy distribution per layer.

(2) Find the "virtual" spatil profile of the side-on (yz/xz) energy deposition distribution for the whole beam.

Need:

-2d histograms:
    -> xy/per layer. From there can get the y-axis projection using ROOT.
-1d histogram:
    -> yz and xz energy deposition
    -> Energy deposition/event in each layer's detector.

Relevant data required:
-Energy deposition per layer
-xyz-coordinate

Also might want:
-Energy distribution of bremsstrahlung created at from target. 


First:
Create simulation using monoenergetic pencil beam of gammas, then simulate a target (it should also be a sensitive detector of some kind to measure the brems energy distribution).



Changes: need to get rid of the 'primary particle' arguments in each of the files, not relevant. Also fix the indexing, as of now the simulation is indexing the per-layer info incorrectly. 

Access the position data in the event action class, and figure out how to store that information in a 2d histogram... make a SD? Cross reference Hadr_05, B5, and amsCal.
