V2 of filter stack simulation.

(1) Find the energy deposition profile per layer, and the face-on (here xy-plane) spatial energy distribution per layer.

(2) Find the "virtual" spatil profile of the side-on (yz/xz) energy deposition distribution for the whole beam.

Need:

-2d histograms:
    -> xy/per layer. From there can get the y-axis projection using ROOT.
    -> yz and xz energy deposition
-1d histogram:
    -> Energy deposition/event in each layer's detector.

Relevant data required:
-Energy deposition per layer
-xyz-coordinate

Also might want:
-Energy distribution of bremsstrahlung created at from target. 


First:
Create simulation using monoenergetic pencil beam of gammas, then simulate a target (it should also be a sensitive detector of some kind to measure the brems energy distribution).

Goals 2024-04-04:
    -> Revert back to the John Francis thing. All that's really needed is a change to the event action class, and Run/RunAction classes to get the detector geometry. Could also just do this the amseCal way. Need to do some troubleshooting and debugging to make the program more concise.
