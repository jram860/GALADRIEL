# Codebase for the Geant4 Simulations of beam profiler diagnostic at GALADRIEL

- Spectrum Sims: Generates the bremsstrahlung X-Ray energy distribution at the backside of a foil target irradiated with                   a pencil beam.
- profilerConverterFoil: Generates the spatial distribution in scintillating fiber arrays for the GALADRIEL Combined                               Profiler Experiment. There is a converter foil in front of the detector.
- profilerSensitivity: Genereates the Sensitivity curves for a profiler over a range of monoenergetic pencil beams.
