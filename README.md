# Codebase for Geant4 simulations of beam profiler diagnostics at GALADRIEL


### Contents
- Spectrum Sims: Generates the bremsstrahlung X-Ray energy distribution at the backside of a foil target irradiated with a pencil beam.

- profilerConverterFoil: Generates the spatial distribution in scintillating fiber arrays for the GALADRIEL Combined Profiler Experiment. There is a converter foil in front of the detector.

- profilerSensitivity: Genereates the Sensitivity curves for a profiler over a range of monoenergetic pencil beams.
